# Battleship-Simulator
Simulation of the game "Battleship"

This simulator has 3 different inputs for 3 types of games:
  - A mini game between two "mediocre" AI
  - A real game between us, the human, and a mediocre player
  - And finally a 10-game match between the mediocre player and the good player
 Each AI is significantly better than the previous, where each has their own strategy of destroying the other's ships.
 The game was created with the idea of inheritance in mind for the AI, as well as the usage of efficient data structures to 
 limit the complexity of the game. 
 
 This Battleship Simulator was created for Spring '22 CS32 class taught by David Smallberg.
